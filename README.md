# Callstackninja
A VS Code extension to visualize the call stack in a more friendly way
than the traditional call stack displayed by the debugger.

# Usage
1. After installing this extension, add breakpoints to the lines that needs to be debugged
2. Run the extension from the command pallette using `ctrl + shift + p` and searching for `Visualize Stack`
3. Watch the magic happen in the next column when you use the debugger as you normally would âœ¨

# Steps To Contribute (Developer)
- Clone the project
- Open using VS Code
- Do not click yes on C# (extension) popup that requires assets to build and debug
- in the terminal `npm install`
- if you don't see out folder in the root path, run this cmd in the terminal `npm run compile` to generate the file.
- F5 to open the dev env IDE
- From the IDE open the Sample folder which contains .NET 6 project
- Make sure that you have .NET 6 SDK & runtime installed
- In the terminal hit `dotnet run` to ensure that it works as expected
- Ctl_Shift+P then write Visualize Stack and hit enter
- Now F5 & You should be able to see the drawings in there
